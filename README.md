## Features In Progress / Planned

- **National ID Login with Fayda:**  
  Integration of Faydaâ€™s national ID login is about 70% complete but currently not stable. It will be finalized and fully integrated after the hackathon.

- **Additional Medical Features:**  
  Pages such as Medical Records, Lab Results, Appointment, Prescriptions, and Emergency Info are planned but not yet implemented.

## Known Issues

- Some demo data is used in the Card Info section; this will be replaced with real backend data in the next version.  
- Fayda login and user data fetching need more work to become reliable.
